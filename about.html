            <h3>God's own country</h3>
            <h2>Kerala,</h2>
            <p>Famously known as 'God's Own Country', Kerala is a state located on the Malabar coast of Southern India. Home to a vast network of brackish lagoons called backwaters, ayurvedic massages, wildlife sanctuaries, sprawling tea gardens, hill-stations, palm tree-lined beaches and colourful dance forms, Kerala has everything on offer to take your pick from!</p>
            <h4>BEST TIME TO VISIT</h4>
            <p>Kerala is best when explored in the winter season. The summers in Kerala are too hot for comfort and hence it is best to be avoided. Also, the main monsoons keep the state wet all throughout the season. Although it can be a beautiful amalgamation of scenic views, it becomes difficult to explore outdoor activities during the monsoons.</p>
            <p>So the best time definitely is during the winter season. One can enjoy adventure activities, go boating and trekking and all this while being comfortable.</p>
            <h4>HOW TO REACH: FOR INDIAN CITIZENS, FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVELLERS</h4>
            <h5>1. By Air</h5>
            <p>There are three international airports located in Kerala; Thiruvananthapuram International Airport, Kochi International Airport and the Calicut International Airport. The airports are connected to both India as well as international cities.</p>
            <h5>2. By Rail</h5>
            <p>Kerala is well-connected to all the major cities of India. Kerala has around 200 railway stations in Kerala. They connect places both within and outside Kerala. </p>
            <h5>2. By Road</h5>
            <p>The roads of Kerala are a breeze to drive/ride on. The state is directly connected by road to neighbouring states of South India; like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Other than that the National Highway nos.47, 17 and 49 connect Kerala to the rest of the country.</p>
